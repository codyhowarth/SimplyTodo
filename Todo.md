Todo for todo app

- Add a timestamp feature so that completed items show their completion date
instead of just showing their due date (which makes no sense)

- Design/produce an app icon

- Add a method giving the user the ability to clear the list of completed
items - generate a toast asking 'Are you sure you want to clear all completed
items?'
